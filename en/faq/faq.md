Instead of using Div/CSS for drawing, Egret draws all the elements onto a Canvas. Almost all of the elements are displayed in this Canvas, so developers don't need to know anything about Div/CSS.

### **What is node.js and why does using Egret need to install node.js?**

Node.js is a platform built on the Chrome JavaScript running to easily build fast, easy-to-expand applications. Developers only need to write JavaScript scripts to complete cross-platform development (Win/Mac/Linux).

All of Egret's command scripts (such as creating new projects, compiling code, compressing code, publishing as NativeApp, etc.) are all based on node.js. The TypeScript language compiler (tsc\) is also running on the node.js platform.. So developers should install node.js before using Egret.
